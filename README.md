==== Amoveo C miner

This is a work in progress, you cannot yet mine.

By writing a miner for Amoveo in C, it becomes easier to write miners for the GPU and FPGAs.
This simple C miner is a template for making miners in other languages.

[Here is a link to where the same mining is implemented in erlang. The 'pow' function is the one to look at](https://github.com/BumblebeeBat/pink_crypto)
